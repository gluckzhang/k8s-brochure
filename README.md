# Background
I'm quite into Docker and Kubernetes, and have some IaaS resource at hand. So I tried to build a nice Kubernetes cluster from scratch instead of deploying the applications directly to some cloud platform. In this way I learn more about the design of Kubernetes and also have the total control of my cluster on host machine level.

# Project Structure
Each folder describes one key step of my Kubernetes configuration, with a document and all the relevant source code.

# Tested Kubernetes Version
v1.13.2
